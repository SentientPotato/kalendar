`kalendar` helps you place regular dates, like July 9, 2023 into the liturgical calendar of The Episcopal Church, like "Sunday, Proper 9 (the Sixth Sunday After Pentecost), Lectionary Cycle A, Daily Office Year One".
("kalendar" is a spelling variant of "calendar" that's used particularly for liturgical calendars, see <https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kalendar>).

## Installation

You can install the development version of kalendar from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

# install.packages("devtools")
